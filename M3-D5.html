            START FROM A SELECTED VERSION OF SPOTIFY (could be one of your version, a mix of all of them.. Your pick)

            The goal is to implement, as a team:
            - Album Page
            - Artist Page

            It's strongly recomended to have a shared style file from which you can reuse things like "player bar, album icon etc"

            For the Album Page, use the https://deezerdevs-deezer.p.rapidapi.com/album/{id} API.
            You can get the album ID from the search API es.: json.data[0].album.id

            For the Artist page, use the https://deezerdevs-deezer.p.rapidapi.com/artist/{id} API
            You can get the artist ID from the search API es.: json.data[0].artist.id

            On every Song in the main page, add artist and album. 
            By clicking on Album the user must go to the specific album page

            Use the query string parameter to pass the ID, example:
            artist.html?id=141414

            Same thing for the album, when the user click on the album name, it should be redirected to something like:
            album.html?id={id album}
